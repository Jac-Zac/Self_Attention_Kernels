-> spar and math (programs)

He think that it is feasible. one more year is a good idea to do. Don't get staack for too mamny years though.

Pick a nice project for the thesis and try to publish something. Even if it is not what you are going to do it still might be interesting

### Note very good idea for my future

> Perhaps you can also get compute tijme for this if you manage to create a good project for cineca

1. Perhaps train a transcoder on Language Diffiusion Model (advance Deep Learning)

   > I can use this https://github.com/safety-research/circuit-tracer

2. So that for NLP you can try to do interpretability on those learned models or something
   > One step Bert might stil be interesting

You can look if somebody did any interpretability on models like mamba and port that also to diffiusion LLMS

### Phd and Intersihp

You can go to ELIS also not impossible. You have to try even for intership perhaps.
Though those are not really **innovative** ideas. But perhaps groundbreaking ideas are a bit _too_ hard so reasonable about that too.
